Python Data Structures: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks in google colab explaining Python's fundamental data structures, including:

Lists: Mutable, ordered collections with indexing and slicing.
Tuples: Immutable sequences for fixed data storage.
Sets: Unique, unordered collections with efficient membership checks.
Dictionaries: Key-value pairs for optimized lookups.
ðŸ“Œ Why Learn These?
Mastering these structures helps in efficient programming, data manipulation, and algorithm optimization.

ðŸ“‚ Notebooks Included:
âœ… list_in_python.ipynb - Deep dive into Python lists with examples.
âœ… tuples.ipynb - Understanding tuples and their use cases.
âœ… set_in_python.ipynb - Set operations, uniqueness, and performance insights.
âœ… dictionaries.ipynb - Working with key-value data efficiently.
